# IDEddit
Browse Reddit through a dummy IDE.


### Libraries Used
  * PyQT5 (GUI for the program) [PyQT5]
  * PRAW (for Reddit API) https://github.com/praw-dev/praw
  * anytree (helped a lot while parsing comments from posts) https://github.com/c0fec0de/anytree
  
### Issues to keep in mind
  * The application can break crash easily, if there are a lot of requests. 
  * Some comments won't be displayed due to Reddit API limitations, more info here https://github.com/praw-dev/praw/issues/1043#issuecomment-471233284
