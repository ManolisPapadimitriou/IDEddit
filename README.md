# IDEddit
Browse Reddit through a dummy IDE.


### Credits
  * [PyQT5] (GUI for the program)
  * [PRAW] (wrapper for Reddit API) 
  * [anytree] (helped a lot while parsing comments from posts) 
  * [Java class] (used as an example)
  
### Issues to keep in mind
  * The application can break crash easily, if there are a lot of requests. 
  * Some comments won't be displayed due to Reddit API limitations, more info [here]
